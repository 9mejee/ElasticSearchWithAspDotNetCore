PM > Install-Package NEST -Version 7.17.5

Why NEST and not Elasticsearch.NET. Elasticsearch.NET is a low-level,dependency-free client that has no opinions about how you build and represent requests and responses. 
NEST is a high-level client that comes with the advantage of having mapped all the requests and responses. 
It maps strongly typed query DSL with Elasticsearch query DSL. NEST is internally built on top of Elasticsearch.NET.
